At the bazar

The sun, shining very brightly on the sellers tents, shows no mercy in the midday heat of the day. 
And still, the glow of the traditional market, with the ever-smelling freshly picked local fruits 
and vegetables overshadows the notion of the nearly insufferable heat. At this famous 
‘all costs 10 $’ bazar Saturday morning, the seller unfortunately fails at selling 
three types of goods 5 minutes before the bazar closes: Pink stuffed elephants, 
bright sun flowers and unstable cardboard bicycles. This is why he quickly got the idea 
to change the prices of the goods, however, not all in favour of the buyer. 
The pink stuffed elephants’ prices increase by 3 $, the bright sun flowers decrease by 5 $ 
and the cardboard bicycles cost 2 $ more than the pink stuffed elephants in the end. 
A buyer comes by and buys one item each. Has the bazar seller gained or lost money 
by changing the prices compared to not changing the money? And how much money has he gained or lost?
