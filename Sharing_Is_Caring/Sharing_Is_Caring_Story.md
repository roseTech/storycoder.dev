## Sharing is Caring
This story is dedicated to the famous Christmas hacking taking place during advent.

Scene: Santa and the elves Cody, Louisa, Sleepy, Noisy, Buildy, Calcy, Singy, Sneaky and Drinky

And Santa excitingly, but also slightly stressed, looks at his overly punctual, never late watch and shouts: 
“Elves, let’s move it, move it, the backpacks are finally on board, we need to depart!”

The elves happily, but also utterly exhausted, take their cushioned Christmassly decorated seats in Santa’s overloaded sleigh! 
Coloured presents, fir tree branches, reindeer equipments, cookies, open milk jugs, and a lot of personal traveling items are on board of this sleigh 
(yes, almost unbelievable, but some elves heavily exaggerated on the allowed amount of personal baggage). 
But Santa was courageously relaxed about this, as he knows in the end that some elves, mostly always the same ones, 
exceed the allowed baggage limit also when they travel on planes! On top of the vast amount of personal belongings, each elves carries a lot a lot of sweets: 100 pieces of cookies, caramels, chocolate trees, chewing gums, candies and ginger breads each in their backpack. 

“Yeyy”, said Noisy, “we’re going on a road trip”, while heartily listening to Christmas carols on his inherited old school disc man! 
Excitement arises, and the elves’ hearts start beating faster, except for the really tired elves, they’re bound to fall asleep, 
among them is Sleepy. Louisa, also known as the bookworm elf, deepens into her late grandma’s favorite Christmas story book. Cody, however, 
is doing the 5th day of Christmas hacking today on his new (N-1)1 computer, as he somehow found a way to get the challenge a day prior. 
Buildy, on the other hand, is building a wooden mini sleigh, whereas Singy is singing, Calcy is doing math and Drinky is drinking cinnamon latte.

And then there is Sneaky, who, because everyone else is doing something, decides, out of sneakishness, to take away food from Louisa’s bag. 
Noisy sees this, thinks to himself: “How unfair is that, so typical of Sneaky”; but then decides to also take food from other elves’ bags as well. 
And the sneakishness among the elves continues.

# Documentation:
### Sitting positions of the elves in the sleigh:

- Cody       Louisa       Sleepy

- Noisy       Buildy      Calcy

- Singy       Sneaky      Drinky


At the beginning each elf has 100 pieces of each food type, which are: cookies, caramels, chocolate trees, chewing gums, candies and ginger breads.

- Every elf having a neighbour to the right takes 2 cookies from that neighbour and eats 1/2 (half) of them.
- Every elf having a neighbour to the left takes 6 caramels from that neighbour and eats 1/3 of them
- Every elf in the middle that has neighbours left and right, takes from them each 3 chocolate trees and none get eaten.
- Every elf having an elf sitting behind them, takes 8 chewing gums from that elf and 1/4 of stolen cheewing gum gets eaten. 
- Every elf having an elf sitting in front of them, takes 8 candies from that elf and 1/2 of stolen candies gets eaten. 
- Every elf having an elf sitting in front and in the back of them, takes 2 ginger breads from that each of those elves and 3/4 of stolen ginger breads gets eaten.

# Take a Guess. Non-Codable Questions:
1) The story contains many (pop) cultural references to books, music, tech, etc.; what are they?
2) Before coding take a guess: Which elves do you think carries the most food pieces at the end?

# Questions:
1) Find which elf has the highest amount of food at the end - print name and total amount.

2) For each elf, find which type of food that elf has in highest amount - print name, food type and the amount.

3) Find total amount of all food elves have and check what percentage is missing compared to start of the journey - print total number and percent of missing food.


Santa, together with his elves, decides that after coding this story, they would put all their foods on the table and share. And the moral of the story is: Sharing is caring!


### See example below for the Cookies:

- Cody takes two cookies from Lousia
- Cody eats half of stolen cookies
- Luisa has now 100-2=98 cookies
- Cody has 100+(2-1)=101 cookies

- Luisa takes two cookies from Sleepy
- Luisa has now 98+(2-1) cookies
