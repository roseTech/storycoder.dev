Text Message to a Crush

Thumbs feverishly hit the phone screen 📱. The sentence on screen reads 👓: “I’d love to meet you tonight 🌃 but right now is.” 
You stop 🛑…Deleting the text in the message composer. You look up and ask whether this is the right message 💌 to send to your new crush 💕. 
Your friend shrugs his shoulders and says, “I don’t know..🤔” and the laughter of the night pushes you away😃. 
You walk outside, look at the moon 🌛, and breathe in and out. You think, “Let’s do this!” 📝 
Write a fun, serious, or witty text response to a fictional crush. Print your fictional text message.
