Johanns Harp

7 Year old Johann was playing outside in the woods. He loved this. The forest
had so many beautiful things. Birds singing in a wide range of different chirps.
A deer just hidden behind an oak tree. Frogs, snakes,  ... all of them playing
music ... a symphony.

His mom also had a folk harp at home, but the harp could only play some melodies
but not all of them. That's not how it should be. Johann wanted an instrument
where he could play any melody, whenever he wanted. Johann already new that the
harp was made out of many strings, and that this strings were vibrating when mom
was playing. You could even see the vibrations, if you would look closely. His
mom told him, that if a string vibrates twice as fast as another string, this is
called an octave. If Johann really paid close attention he could see that some
string were vibrating faster than other ones. If they were vibrating twice as
fast it somehow sounded twice as high.

He was thinking for a very long time and asking all animals in the woods for any
inspiration and it was not until a group of dragon flies, all with different
wings spans flew close to him, and gave him the inspiration he was reeking for.
If he would make 13 strings each 6% faster then the previous one, the 13th one
would be twice as fast as the first one. And he tried this out many times until
he found this, 1 * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106% * 106%
* 106% * 106% * 106% this would result in 2.01. But isn't there a more precise
number than 6%? A number which would really result in a factor of exactly 2?

He would make an instrument with 88 different notes, and one should be allow to
play it silently (piano) and loud (forte) like the animals, a piano fortissimo
instrument.
