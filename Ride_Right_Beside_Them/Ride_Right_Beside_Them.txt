Ride Right beside them

It looked unforgettably mind-blowing from above, like a geometrically consistent, yet artfully beautiful picture. 
One that you would like to look at, hanging solemnly in your living room area, one that you can stare at forever, 
constantly finding endless details of this memorable city. Sometimes, glancing at it for too long, it seems mesmerizing, 
with their ever-riding objects, portraying bicycles, moving in a delightfully rhythmical, yet totally undisturbing way. 
It evokes some kind of inner stability, pondering at the masses of bicycles all following a wonderfully marked track. 
The colors strike as amazing, as all of the riders are exemplarily wearing colorful helmets to prevent dangerous accidents. 
It feels like they’re riding marvelously forever, and forever somehow evokes security. But forever is not always forever, 
as suddenly, one group of riders seems to split from the main group, causing the fascinating chain to break abruptly. 
The picture has quickly changed. They’re riding somewhere, but where are they heading to? It appears they’re lost in cyclation! 
While unconsciously distancing themselves from the main riders, the lost riders are determined to find their way back again: 
They wish to ride right beside them, in order to catch up to preserve the beauty of the picture. 
They wonder if only there was an app to show them the cycle path next time 😉?

The lost group rides along the following streets listed below in that order. In this magic city, the distance between one street 
and the next street is calculated by adding the values of the letters that the street names hold. Every letter holds the values below. 
Print how many kilometers the lost group rides.

While approaching, a man is screaming all street names in said order, however, the lost group can only hear every second letter 
of the street names. Print which letters the lost group hears.
