# Percy and the Humans
Once upon a time, we write the year 3022, November 30, in a land far, far away, there lived a penguin named Percy. Percy lived in a small, cozy igloo at the edge of the frozen tundra. He spent his days fishing for krill and swimming in the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean.

One day, while out fishing, Percy stumbled upon a group of 8 explorers who were lost in the vast expanse of the frozen north. The explorers were cold, hungry, and scared, but Percy was determined to help them.

With his sharp eyes and keen sense of direction, Percy led the explorers back to his igloo. There, he shared his small, medium and big-sized fish and warm blubber with the grateful travelers sitting around the bond fire 🔥, saving their lives.

Percy starts passing around a big fish, while each explorer takes a piece. After 19 pieces the fish is fully split. Then Percy continues passing a medium fish to the next person where the last fish was split. After 11 pieces, the medium fish was fully split as well. After this the penguin continues passing a small fish to the next person where the last fish was split. And after 5 pieces, the small fish was fully split as well. Percy continues to do this for a while in this particular order.
Print how many big fish, medium fish and small fish 🐟 does it take for every of the 8 explorer to have at least 117 pieces of big fish, medium fish and small fish? See documentation below.

The explorers were so grateful for Percy’s help that they decided to take him with them on their journey back to civilization. Together, they traveled across the frozen tundra, braving the harsh elements and dangerous wildlife.

At last, they reached the safety of a nearby town, where they were welcomed with open arms. Percy quickly became a local celebrity, known for his bravery and kindness. He was scared at first, because he hadn’t told anyone yet that he wasn’t born naturally, but that he was created artificially. He was created through artificial intelligence exactly 1000 years ago, and that is why he survived all these years and lived far away in the south pole. But then Percy took all his courage and told the humans his real origins.

From that moment on Percy lived the rest of his days in comfort and happiness, surrounded by friends and loved ones. He never forgot his humble beginnings, and remained grateful for the adventures that had led him to his new home.
The end.
