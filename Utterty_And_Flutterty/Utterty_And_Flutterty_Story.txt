Utterty and Flutterty 🦋♥️🦋 

On a perfect summer evening, flying around as if love never ends, dreaming beyond as if love never sleeps 
and fluttering around as if love never lands, there is Butterfly Utterty 🦋. Being so in love and nervous 💘, 
he nearly forgets to put on his newly purchased rose-tinted glasses 🤓 to go out today . 
He’s having so many butterflies in his stomach, even though he is a butterfly himself 😂😂😂. 
Of course some wonder, if that’s even possible 🧐😂. He’s flying around and from far far away, in his rose-coloured sky, 
there comes flying Butterfly Flutterty 🦋. He of course asks her for a date ♥️ to play dart 🎯 together. 
Flutterty, however, agrees only upon certain condition: If Utterty can list the first four lines 
of her most favourite Shakespeare sonnet ever (which is Sonnet 116) however using only every second letter. 
Otherwise she’s not interested in dating Utterty 🥲! Help Utterly to pass that challenge.

Shakespeare, Sonnet 116
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
