# Poseidons Ice Cubes 🧊🧊🧊⚓️🧜‍♂️

It’s boat day today ⛵ with beautiful weather at the sea 🌅 , and all is packed
to seize the day to the fullest, to ‘carpe diem’ 😃, just as famous Roman poet
Horace had suggested to do everyday.

However, for some reason, the mighty water God Poseidon 🔱🧜‍♂ has not enjoyed
his drinks 🍹 last night as much as he usually does; and threw a lot of spare
ice cubes from the drinks into the sea 🌊!

Thus, the water got extensively colder 🥶; to be more specific it is 11.475
Seidons cold now, which is 14 Seidons colder than normally. Thus today swimming
is not allowed. Seidon is the temperature unit of the sea. 1 Seidon divided by
1.37 equals 1 Degree Celsius.

Print the water temperature 🌡️ in both entities with max two fraction digit
with an equation on a normal, ice-cube free day!
